# Sales Trend Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing sales trends over time. It helps in understanding patterns, identifying peak sales periods, and making data-driven decisions.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Sales trend visualization
- Identifying seasonality and anomalies
- Forecasting future sales trends using Exponential Smoothing
- Generating insights for business decisions

## Model Used

This analysis utilizes **Exponential Smoothing** from the `statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters` module. Exponential Smoothing is a time series forecasting method that accounts for trends and seasonality in sales data. It is particularly useful for short-term sales forecasting by adjusting the importance of past observations through smoothing parameters.

And also using apply  ARIMA AND ARMA MODEL TO Anaylsis this dataset 


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-trend-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-trend-analysis
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run the `sales trend analysis.ipynb` notebook.

## Data

Ensure your dataset is in the correct format before running the analysis. The notebook expects a structured dataset with sales records over time.

## Model Comparison and Analysis
Based on three result i can say ARIMA model is the best choice among this model because it has the lowest MSE by significant margin
Maintains comparable MAE and RMSE to the improved and ARMA model 
The extremely low p-value in ADF test confirms strong stationarity,which is ideal for ARIMA MODLELING
